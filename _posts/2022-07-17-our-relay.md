> Update: This relay runs nostream now but apparently can't handle the traffic and
remains being a playground until
[this bounty](https://bountsr.org/relay-with-wot-based-limits/) finds a winner.

This post serves to clarify what to expect from `wss://relay.nostr.info`.

This relay runs the Kotlin based
[NostrPostr Relay](https://github.com/Giszmo/NostrPostr#nostrrelay)
and at this time is more a playground than a stable and reliable backbone of the
nostr network. I push changes without announced down time and for example the
next change will mean some minutes of down time  or at least of not relaying
newer stored events, as it will sync from other relays to a new DB, switching
from SQLite to PostgresDB.

Please use it, try it out and report if you can identify issues.
